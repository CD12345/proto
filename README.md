# Float Pointer Exporter

This extension for Visual Studio 2022 adds a context menu item that allows exporting data from a `float*` pointer during debugging. Select the name of the pointer variable in a C++ source file, right-click and choose **Export**. Specify the output path and number of `float` elements, and the extension will read the memory from the debugged program and save the values to a text file.
